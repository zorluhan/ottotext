Ottoman orthography guidance (short):
- Convert Turkish Latin text to Ottoman Arabic script without translation.
- Preserve punctuation and numbers.
- Use common forms (e.g., ك for k, گ for g before front vowels, ق otherwise; ى for i in final; و for u/o; ي for i/e).
- When word ends with -n and represents -ng, prefer final NG (ﯓ) if available.
